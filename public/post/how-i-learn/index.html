<p>I suck at being consistent. I get distracted easily. Most learning content, I’ve either abandoned or skimmed. There’s very little I’ve actually finished, much less deeply in that scope.</p>
<h2 id="for-structured-theory-heavy-courses">For Structured Theory heavy Courses:</h2>
<p>I watch them while eating food. It’s intriguing.</p>
<p>Example: Behavioural Psychology by Robert Sapolsy on Youtube</p>
<h2 id="for-structured-technical-content-on-udemy-or-youtube">For Structured Technical Content on Udemy or YouTube:</h2>
<p>Most Youtube content I end up rewatching if I catch something of interest or something of high technical detail that I have to have to implement to understand, I do a code-along with the instructor. Udemy, depending on my familiarity and complexity with the subject, I either do a code-along dissecting and googling every little bit or skip and skim at 2x speed to the relevant bits. Most Youtube courses I don’t end up finishing because I get distracted or the context is generic and too long.</p>
<p>Freecodecamp and brad traversy have some of the best quality content on tech. For these videos, I go to the end first to see what we’re building and if it’s interesting before starting.</p>
<p>Udemy works with a little bit of persistence because of bite sized videos and I can pick up where I left off from which becomes hard in case of YouTube videos.
Handwritten notes never made sense here. Pushing junk code or tiny screenshots to GitHub made more sense in these cases.</p>
<p>TLDR: Different things work for different people. Find what you’re comfortable with. Each platform is a little weird and different.</p>
<p>Content on Udacity like platforms are much more easier to access natively over YouTube as a playlist because you can autoplay and not have to change the 2X bit for every video.</p>
<h2 id="for-relatively-new-fields-or-unstructured-fields-where-theres-very-little-curation">For relatively new fields or unstructured fields where there’s very little curation:</h2>
<p>I end up scouring through torrents, books and associated fields. I google for potential keywords that might be associated with the topic and read up just enough to know its role and relevance in the initial topic.
Came across 3D printing, game theory, OpSec and Applied Cryptography from Bitcoin in this manner.</p>
<p>Stalk prominent people’s social media, evaluate and subscribe/follow who they follow. See if they’ve recommended books on <a href="https://www.kevinrooke.com/book-recommendations">https://www.kevinrooke.com/book-recommendations</a></p>
<p>Read summaries or YouTube talks of their work. Kanzure, Lopp, Jimmy Song and Andreas Antonopolous did a lot for bitcoin in this manner. Same goes for szabo, Adam Back and nakamoto institute. I’d search anything and everything they’d posted about, I’d pore through their GitHub, who they follow, projects they’ve forked, starred and committed to.</p>
<p>Today, it’s mostly Balaji Srinivasan. He taught a Course on startup via Coursera/stanford that is still relevant today. His YC talk on Exit voice and Loyalty is beautiful. Often if they write books, it’s worth reading summaries of them. These people act as oracles and have done a good amount of research to classify what’s worthwhile content to consume. I follow this process for both the yay and the naysayers. It helps to be open to opinions as long as they make sense in some manner. Ethereum became popular around bitcoin circles first before going mainstream.
This approach makes sense only for new and emerging fields and if you care about them significantly. Following accounts that tweet on straws degrading the environment, memes or jokes hold novelty for very little time. Use discretion there.
It makes sense to just go down the rabbit hole sometimes (on wikipedia or anywhere where there’s links)</p>
<h2 id="for-books">For Books</h2>
<h3 id="for-non-technical-prose-heavy-academia">For non technical prose heavy Academia</h3>
<p>One Strategy that worked in school was to read issued curriculum like a story book initially. Eventually, I’d come back after imagining context throughout the day and reread to see if I had gotten the gist. In boarding school, doing this at 6AM with a beverage helped. I’d sit in the same spot and read it just out of curiosity. I didn’t have a teacher for that subject. I read not more than 15-20 minutes at a stretch. It ended up being my highest scoring subject.</p>
<p>TLDR: Spaced Repetition with “it’s just a story” approach and a reward in the end. Sometimes, having someone read it out loud also helps.</p>
<p>I’d imitate my Biology and History lecturers in School; Chemistry Professors in 11th. During the exams, I’d just be able to see and listen to their lectures in my head. The flair in which they spoke, I’d watch it like a movie in class and could replay it in my head during exams; I remember them even now.</p>
<p>Similarly, I listen to biographies and history books, mostly in the author’s voice and I can recall and feel their emotion over time.</p>
<p>TLDR: Finding someone with a unique accent, flair, charisma to act it like a movie would increase retention and recall. Even YouTube animations/graphics work great.</p>
<h3 id="for-technical-books">For technical books:</h3>
<p>Spaced repetition for complex books and the story book method for the how-to books with minimal note taking helped.</p>
<p>I have a book on Applied cryptography that I haven’t finished in &gt;4 years and various O’reily and Apress (Pro____ and____Cookbook) books that I’ve finished in one 4 hour sitting.Would walk into a bookstore and walk out 3-4 hours later with a tiny paper with everything I needed to google to find the relevant content in the book.</p>
<p>Some people learn by implementing, I’ve found most technical books low-hanging books on stacks to be outdated and mostly a simplified version of the documentation. Getting the gist is often more helpful than the exact details.</p>
<p>They’re hand-holding for those that don’t know how to read docs and that has helped me before. It still does while exploring relatively new technologies.</p>
<h2 id="for-learning-a-new-piece-of-a-programming-language--framework">For learning a new piece of a programming language / Framework</h2>
<p>This is exactly what I’d do, If I had to delve into a new ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand basic syntax</li>
<li>Look at example projects</li>
<li>Scaffold and setup to understand bit by bit</li>
<li>Build and get from code to the finished product and see it happen</li>
<li>Then find best practices and open source projects, find ”awesome” resources for that particular library/framework; There’s always an “awesome” list and it’s pretty cool/</li>
<li>Read Docs and implementation practices</li>
<li>Look up best case scenario and optimisation requirements</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="for-learning-a-new-spoken-language-in-a-new-city--country">For learning a new spoken language in a new city / country:</h2>
<p>Make a list of all questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How</li>
<li>What</li>
<li>Why</li>
<li>When</li>
<li>Please</li>
<li>Sorry</li>
<li>Thank you</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure out what the respectable addressable words and salutations are.</p>
<p>In Hindi, Aap and Tum are perecived differently.</p>
<p>Ask the locals to teach you their language just a little bit and ask for context each time. Blatantly imitate without fearing judgment, that’s when it feels right, else it feels fake.Most nouns are the same in English or the locals can understand / empathise.
Make a note of the common vernacular, slangs and straight forward questions</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="a-tease-based-approach">A tease Based Approach:</h4>
<p>I’ve paid people to hold my money or something I really like hostage until I finish something. This approach isn’t necessarily healthy over longer periods of time unless you have a good relationship with the person, but the thought of receiving a reward or the chase is exciting.
This works well for short sprints.</p>
<h4 id="dedicated-time-approach">Dedicated Time Approach:</h4>
<p>Allocating a set time for a particular activity.
Irrespective of how trivial or minor the progress is as long as complete focus was on it, it becomes easier and easier to do this over multiple iterations.
Helps if you maintain a calendar regularly and like slotting activities into time buckets.</p>
<h4 id="a-goal-based-approach">A goal based Approach:</h4>
<p>This tends to work in minor incremental change type activities.
A couple of hours of research or a day of research before first action item and then implementing it with a heavily sugared hot drink has worked for me. It has a defined objective, I’d have done the research and know exactly what’s required. This is one of the most fulfilling ways to work.
The heavily sugared drink isn’t necessary but having something light to consume or to fidget allows you to think when you’re in the zone. It’s just the right amount of distraction.</p>
<h2 id="what-hasnt-worked">What hasn’t worked:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A cluttered and an uncomfortable workspace. Every second irks.</li>
<li>Being on the bed or a comfortable couch which is generally used for sleeping.</li>
<li>A different / foreign space each day. Using the same one spot daily has worked for scoped items.</li>
<li>Pushing things off to tomorrow. Even a minor research of 5 webpages on a topic is better than pushing everything off to the next day.</li>
<li>Relying on an external factor to help on a time constrained deliverable unless there’s history. Everything is better with buffers.</li>
<li>Transcribing handwritten notes to Digital format</li>
<li>Aiming for a perfect / beautiful presentation of notes, most notes are meant to be visited to get the context not to go through every single verbally recited line of the course. Transcripts would’ve been better for that level of granularity.</li>
<li>I’ll remember this for later</li>
<li>I’ll finish this tomorrow</li>
<li>If I stay up for 24/36 hours straight, I can finish this. (Body needs rest and doesn’t co-operate after a while)</li>
<li>I’ll do this later</li>
<li>Swearing at something if it isn’t working. Restarting the laptop has worked sometimes.</li>
<li>Taking a walk to debug a problem</li>
<li>Unstructured Learning : I’d do a 1000 tutorials but earlier history shows I didn’t understand how they tied together and why that approach was taken. Also it left a lot of unfinished items</li>
<li>Not defining a scope. Undefined scope has often produced bad work, shitty learning experiences and feels unsatisfactory.</li>
<li>Extended Breaks longer than 2 days. I tend to forget often and find the need to start over because I feel insecure about not doing it right.</li>
<li>Doing &gt;3 things at the same time. It goes into a state where I feel paralysed and get distracted by something trivial. The importance for each item goes down.</li>
<li>Comparing against people that are better off.</li>
