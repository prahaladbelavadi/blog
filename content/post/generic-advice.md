I notice this trend where people are giving out advice. Not that there's anything wrong with it.
It's just generic. The whole value proposition behind providing advice is to provide a perspective or a form of guidance perhaps on what needs to / can be done. The part about where this advice becomes valuable is when there is or has been skin in the game. 

There are instances where people might recount incidences where others were a key subject and use that as reference for providing advice. 
I feel it's further away from the truth because they implicityly weren't involved or a part of it.

I feel that one becomes qualified to provide advice when they themselves have been through something that they are dishing out opinions on that other people might follow in on.

Example:

If Aaron expresses an opinion about something, that's cool. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. State that it is an opinion as such.

If Aaron is providing advice to betty about something, that advice doesn't mean shit unless aaron has been through a similar set of circumstances.

The difference between advice from a war veteran having Vietnam and From Afghanistan can be similar or different depending on the depth of the context of advice being sought after. 
Is a war happening ?
Where is it happening ?
Who is the war Against ?
What are climatic conditions present ?
Who's side are we on ?
What do we have ?
WHat are we fighting ?
Who are the commanding officers ?
What is the agenda ?

In a culture where advice from elder people is considered sacrimonious, it feels like I have an inherrent responsibility to inform the world about how much bullshit that contains, where it is and why. Not that it is ill intended, it's misplaced and all advice isn't made equal.

There's also a growing population of influencers that are providing information on Legal, Ethical and Medical subjects over platforms like tiktok, instagram and so forth. While some people might be qualified to actually provide advice on such subjects, a vast majority isn't and that hurts the innocent people that don't know how to judge what relevant advice.

I've also noticed that this is a growing on a good set of population where they go on to offer generic advice without hearing out the entirety of the situation. This is akin to a therapist or a doctor that issues a diagnosis before entirely evaluating your condition. It's pre-empted and inaccurate.

The mental model for giving and receiving advice ought to be tuned
I shouldn't impose on other people that their advice is generic or anythign about their communication; It is their free will and right to communicate. I ought to develop a better filter on what's worthwhile and what isn't.

THere's also a positive side of getting advice, because we get keywords and context that we might have never come across otherwise, since different people are consuming different types, forms and relevance content.

Again, one can evaluate if some communication is worth adopting only after hearing it out or receiving it.

Decision: Receive all content, evaluate, Progress; If the evaluation of the content repeatedly turns out to be shit, discard the source altogether.
If the source has no personal stake, experience or if it's been too long since it happened and the timeline or mental model has changed, associate appropriate lower priority factors to it.
