Ashwat was the person who gave me my first tech job.
Today, he's no more.
In the little time that I've known him, he was always cheerful and happy. 
He was optimistic about the world. He wanted things to change and he'd say he'd see it happen.
I sincerely do hope that he's happy where ever he is.

In his memory, I'd like to recount a couple of experiences that I've had the fortune of sharing with him.

- How we met : DCB hackathon
- Meeting at Forum Koramangala
- Visits to Bangalore and Chennai
- Setting up Mindstone, Diamond District and Axis Accelrator
- Dinners at Barbeque Nation and the Rajasthani Place at Indiranagar
- Hanging out at 91 Springboard Indiranagar
- Family dinner at Madras Boat Club

I regret that I did not call him more often; that I did not stay in touch.

As Covid lockdowns ravaged the country, I'm told he was volunteering to arrange mental health support, amneties, for people who were afflicted by the virus. He'd put his heart and soul into it. He could barely sleep at night. He worked tirelessly so that the less fortunate could receive the help that they so badly needed.
That sounds like the Ashwat I knew, tirelessly, cheerfully working for the betterment of everyone around him.

I hadn't met him in ages, I wish I did and that I spent more time talking to him.

He lives on, in our memories.
