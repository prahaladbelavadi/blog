TL;DR
Show a demo of the working product instead of telling people via text messages. 
demo need not be scheduled. It can be a video. Visual representations elicit an action and convey state of being better than text can

Context:
Earlier, there were PRs opened, messages put. Poeple are more active when they can see something tangible. 
It prompts action

Previous storyline:
There's this group I volunteer with.
Initially, I was excited and was keen on doing a demo. I wanted to show my work out to people. People were responsive. Changes were merged quickly and the need of the hour was also high.

Over time, upon receiving a request for a feature addition, I would write the code for it, add a reviewer and let it be.
I presumed that the reviewer would view the PR on their github notifications, review and merge. 
Given how low profile the notifications options on github is and possibly how busy the reviewer would also be , I should've realized that it isn't sufficient.

Upon recording the feature in action and putting it on a chat group, it got merged right away. 

My takeaway is to produce more demos of anything built, as tiny as it might be. It's a lot more visual and prompts an action item compared to a text which informs them that something is ready. Also, always give people the benefit of the doubt. They might have missed the notifications just as easily as I would've. Heck, I have over >5000 github notifications at any given point now.
