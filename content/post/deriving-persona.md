Who do you want to be?

Persona is an unbiased equivalent of the word stereotype.
Stereotypes imply people of this type, doing xy activities exhibit KM behaviour.

The idea of persona is interesting. 
You can literally be anyone you want. The type of activities you do, the type of discipline that is demanded of certain trades tend to leave an imprint. Heck, everything we do in life leaves an imprint on our psyche. 
It helps to understand who are these kinds of people, what are their traits and cherry pick what we think is desirable in ours.

Certain professions skew certain attributes.
People that go to the military are generally fit.
People that cook generally have better dexterity
People that did martial arts younger generally can keep their emotions at check
People that sailed or did boating or did some form of climbing understand how to tie knots really well

Everything leaves a trace
Everything leaves an imprint on your identity

And performing similar activities as per the identity imbue the traits into you.

Similar to perform Fire fighting drills regularly, you're going to be built.
Specific traits are the likelihood of a long chain of career or persoal influence that leave a mark on yours and my persona as people.

    Housing crisis
    Holocaust

- Time Spent
    we spend 8 hours a day sleeping, 8 hours working and 8 hours on other miscellaneous tasks.
    The more time we spend doing a particular type of activity , not only do we develop a reflex towards it but the body implicitly adapts to that particular kind of activity.

- Aspiration
    Who were your role models growing up?
    People that have similar role models aspire to embody that persona, 
    People from similar geographical space would exhibit similar patterns

- Clothing
    Clothing represents an identity of our naked self. it adds flar, poise and so much more. We're accessorizing ourselves to fit into occasions that are socially constructed. Wear similar clothing to a persona that you want to embody

- Circle of influence or engagement
    HIgh agency people hang around other high agency people
    They derive a good bar for who's 



# Idealogical personas
Who do you think you are ?
Did you have to work for it ?
Are you in the process or have you imbibed it into yourself ?


often asking understanding the motivation behind certain personas help us understand what it is that draws us towards that particular gravitas. Understanding our base emotional drive helps us make conscious decisions with regard to the person we want to be and the persona we want to exemplify
